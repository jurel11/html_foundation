      <h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
        language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
        behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
        browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
        users' devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
        language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic
        typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>ECMAScript standard</strong> does not include any
        input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
        In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
        APIs for I/O.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are
        now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The
        most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective
        standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
        design.
      </p>

      <h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web,
        with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are
        embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
      </p>

      <p>
        All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes
        the code on the user's device.
      </p>

      <p>Examples of Scripted Behavior</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a
          WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive
          messages without leaving the current pag
        </li>
        <li>
          Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and
          moving them.
        </li>
        <li>Playing browser games.</li>
        <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>
        <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>
        <li>
          Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server.
          The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and
          personalization.
        </li>
        <li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>
        <li>
          Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or
          IndexedDB standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>React</strong> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and
        open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
        based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
        community of individual developers and companies
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or
        server-rendered applications with frameworks like
        <strong>Next.js.</strong> Because React is only concerned with the user
        interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often
        rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key
        advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page
        that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM
        elements.
      </p>

      <h4>Angular</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a
        <strong>TypeScript-based</strong>, free and open-source single-page web
        application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a
        community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite
        from the same team that built AngularJS
      </p>

      <h4>jQuery</h4>
      <p>
        In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side
        library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in widespread use,
        its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
      </p>

      <h4>Vanilla JS</h4>
      <p>
        The framework-like moniker "<strong>Vanilla JS</strong>" is term that
        has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at
        all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
